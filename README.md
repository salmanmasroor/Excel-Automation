# Excel-Automation

## Project Overview
**Excel-Automation** is a Python project designed to **merge multiple Excel files into a single master file** automatically. It is ideal for automating repetitive Excel tasks, such as combining reports, tracking data, or consolidating weekly/monthly spreadsheets.

The script reads all Excel files in a specified folder, combines their data, and adds a new column to track the **source file** for each row. The final merged file is saved in a user-specified folder with a custom filename.
